# ChatBoxFlutter

## Description

This project is a chat app, made using flutter and firebase.

To use our app, you'll first need to register, then you can logged in. Once it's done, on the bottom right you can update your parameters like your profile picture or your name.

Then on the main page you will see a search bar. You have to search an email in order to contact the targetted person, and you'll be able to contact him by creating a private chat. (At least create two account in order to make it work)

Unfortunately you can't add the targetted person to your contact list, because we found the solution on how to do hit lately, when we didn't have more time.
